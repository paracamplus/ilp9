Implementation of a Programming Language 

This code has been written for a course on code reading and compiler extension.

This is the code of a compiler (and an interpreter) for a simple programming language (with first-class local functions, exceptions, classes). This compiler is studied in a course that trains students to read code and extend it. The main features of that system are:
- the input syntax is XML (checked by a RelaxNG grammar)
- the processed language is somewhat similar to Javascript
- the interpreter and compiler are written in Java
- the compiler produces C code.

This course draws on a course that presented compilation via a series of languages where features were incrementally added. The '9' in 'ilp9' stands for the ultimate version of that series of systems.

## Resources

A lot of resources come with this course:
* The code of the compiler is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/paracamplus/ilp9).
* A [wiki](https://github.com/paracamplus/ilp9/wiki) holding some information such as
 how to install ilp9,
 which rare concepts of C and Java are used in ilp9,
 how to contribute to ilp9
* GitHub also contains some [assignments](https://github.com/paracamplus/ilp9/tree/master/NanoProjects) also called nano-projects
* A [companion site](http://compiler-reading-1.appspot.com/) with
 [slides](http://compiler-reading-1.appspot.com/page?page=goals),
 [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ilp9-2015),

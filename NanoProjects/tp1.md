Course 1 lab session (2 hours)
==============================

Preliminaries
-------------

Download code for ilp9 with

```shell
git clone https://github.com/paracamplus/ilp9.git
```

With Eclipse, create the ilp9 project and run (successfully) the test
suite com.paracamplus.ilp6.test.WholeTestSuite.java

You may share questions, answers or other useful information on
the [ilp9 group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ilp9-2015).
This is a restricted group so please ask to be part of it!

NanoProject
-----------

There is only one nano-project for all groups for this first course.

### NanoProject 1 - question 1 ###

Write an XML program that binds three numbers to the local variables
`a`, `b` and `c` (standing for the coefficients of the equation `ax^2+bx+c`),
computes the discriminant (`b2-4ac`) and outputs the number of (real)
roots of the equation.

### NanoProject 1 - question 2 ###

Turn this program into an additional test. Make sure you know how to
run the entire test suite (including that new test) or just this new
single test.
